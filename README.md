# Football-Win-Prediction

 A simple ML model based on Python, Panda, Random Forest Classifier.
 Webscraped data of previous years using python and used Panda to clean various datas. Used La-Liga as an league example to get the data.
 Precision is at 55% currently, working on improving the precison and accuracy. This is my first time learning or doing anything related to ML.
